1)Strike Price
2)Expiration Date

The longer it takes your option to expire, the more you’ll pay for the call option.

If the strike price is below the current valuation of the security, the option is worth more (will cost you more to purchase) and we call that in the money.

If the strike price is the exact same as the cost of the security, we call that “at the money”.

If the strike price is higher than the cost of the security it’s worth less and costs less and we call that “out of the money”.


Your goal when buying calls is for the security to go up and go as deep into the money as possible.

Then you can sell (sell to close) the call option for a profit.",1623818476,t3_o0apdv,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0apdv/daily_popular_tickers_thread_for_june_15_2021_amc/h1xn5t5/,17,wallstreetbets,"Daily Popular Tickers Thread for June 15, 2021 - AMC | CLNE | CRSR",comments_batch_6.csv,1,0,1,0.09,0.669,0.241,0.9855,1.6813548,-1.7974079

So it proceeded to plummet to around $25 by the end of the day. But I had patience and I held on, and on Monday all of a sudden it took off towards it's current all time high. 

That might not happen so quickly with $CLNE, but if you hold strong it will. The shorts have almost exhausted their shares to short.

What we really need, is a huge group effort to put some volume out there and stop the shorts from having so much price control. They barely have anything left to fight with, all it's gonna take is us staying strong together.

1.	⁠CLNE is the king of renewable fuel used in vehicles. They process methane waste gas from any source they can including animal shit and rotting fruit. They inverse the carbon footprint by processing this into fuel rather then burning it off.
2.	⁠Huge deal with Amazon to fuel their delivery fleet vehicles.
3.	⁠Hugh upside, low risk company knowing that green is the future especially under this administration
4.	⁠The price is right at these levels. Shares are better then options
5.	⁠Market cap is 2.5 billion, meaning it’s small enough to be bullied in either direction massively if needed
6.	⁠6/18 $50,000 worth of calls go in the money if the share price closes at $13 a share or above this Friday. What this means is that the share price will skyrocket next week when funds settle

CLNE is a strong buy. If if the gamma isn’t triggered, this company will do very well in the coming weeks. Therefore it’s a low risk to take for the reward. Best case scenario, we gamma squeeze and make money. Worst case it doesn’t gamma squeeze and we make money in the next few weeks.

Not much risk in losing money when you invest in a good company like this. Bagholders also recover and make money.

🌕🐄💨💨💨💨

EDIT: Stupid apes can keep buying the flavor of the day and keep holding bags or chasing winners and never get ahead.

Smooth brained apes can understand the risk/reward benefit of rolling profits into CLNE and make some serious cash.

The average analyst target for the next year is $15 - that's 36% higher than the current price.

If CLNE gamma squeezes in the next few weeks you'll likely see a quick 25% or higher return. If you purchase and CLNE doesn't squeeze, you can play the long game and likely exit within a year still looking at potentially a 30%+ return.

The company issued a warning to retail investors who are looking to *buy the stock*.

They believe that you will be at the most risk, if you buy the stock. They don't have liability. They don't have a legal obligation to tell you that. You can't sue them. They told you because that's what their analysis leads them to believe.

Second, you're all focusing on the CEO being pantless. Good job, dumb dumbs. Maybe you should have paid a LOT more attention to two key takeaways: 

1) the CEO refused to discuss the MASSIVE $8-10bn of debt that AMC still has.  
2) the CEO outright said there are ***no synthetic shares of AMC in circulation***. That means *no naked short selling*.

You absolute morons upvoted this, but do you have any idea that those words **literally make no sense**.

The price dropped *because sells* ***hit the market***. Thats how the open market works, dumb dumbs. If more sells hit the market than buys, the price *goes down*.

If they were routed through dArK pOoLs then they'd NOT HIT THE MARKET. Well, there's a bit more nuance there... but the point is

Read a fucking book you idiots. And realise your company managed to peak at a market cap some **fifty five times greater than prepandemic levels**...

When projectionists needed to switch out a reel, they would take the (now tired) hamster out of the wheel, snap its neck and throw it in a trash bin, then replace it with a fresh hamster. At the end of the day, they would bring the bin of used hamsters out back behind the theater and throw them out to the homeless people that gathered there each day at closing hoping to get a free snack. One of those homeless people was a newly arrived German immigrant named Claus Von Schittstaïn, who so loved the taste of fresh hamster on a slice of bread that he would go on (after years of saving) to found the first HämsterShäcken in 1942. The restaurant was a fast hit, and soon there were Hamster Shacks (after a name change in 1947) all over the continental U.S. Today, you can find Hamster Shacks in Tokyo and Moscow—just part of a global empire of restaurants serving millions of customers every day.",1623011672,t3_nttgr8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nttgr8/bb_amc_gme_daily_popular_ticker_thread_for_june/h0u0bhh/,12,wallstreetbets,"BB | AMC | GME - Daily Popular Ticker Thread for June 06, 2021",comments_batch_6.csv,1,0,1,0.038,0.837,0.124,0.9558,1.5336592,-1.491286

1598,h2gwgei,0,o4dgc9,ZONGXIAN,JoeDirtBuffett,"AMC has a 5 to 1 post ratio to CLOV in the past week (exclusive posts, not a megathread, daily mention or multi-ticker post). It's a tough argument to say that every AMC post is ""high effort"" in comparison to the CLOV posts that have been removed. I was responding to one titled ""To CLOV or Not to CLOV"" posted earlier today. It was completely original content urging an open discussion. It was removed within 15 minutes.

  
In response to some OP's linking to posts in the CLOV subreddit, that's because there's rampant speculation that mods have somehow been compromised.

So they've transformed many of their locations by including the reclining seating, bars, and other things. I really do hope they are able to continue the transformation so that the theater becomes a center for the community to gather and have that experience.

They are doing In-Home COVID-19 Vaccinations to all Medicare Advantage Members to reduce covid costs. 

They have removed all warrants with their redemption program so that warrant depreciation in each quarter of this year won't show up as an earning loss on their quarterly report anymore.

They got approval from CMS to expand to 101 new counties starting this month and this expansion increases number of counties from 108 to 209 counties. Therefore they should almost double their revenue in the first quarter of next year from the current 412.5 million in 2nd quarter to estimated 700+ millions each quarter of next year.

They got a rating upgrade to 3.5 stars. With 3.5 stars rating, the medicare program will give them 15% more in rebate payment. That 15% increase in rebate payment from medicare is huge boost to their revenue.

They have developer APIs on their website while other competitors don't have and these apis could make them money later. These APIs can be used easily to integrate with other third party apps. 

CEO said once that we are going to expand into other lines of business in the future. So, it means they are going to expand to employee and individual &amp; family health insurance plans.

You should be dumping every bit of money you can muster into GME. Don't fuck your life up, but do get in on a company who will trade far above the current price even after the hype train has left. 

This is the moment you'll regret. The moment in 5 years when you tell friends you *knew* about the hype and *chose* to skip out, where you'll think they'll find it interesting but they only point out how much more you'd have now and make you feel bad, *thats* the one you can finally avoid. This is APPL at 15. It's TSLA at 10. Its AMZN at 200.

You don't have to stress about the squeeze. You can be part of it by helping squeeze the short sellers by buying, making the squeezes more dough, make money no matter what, and be able to say you did your part during the greatest highway robbery to ever take place on the exchange. 

We're crashing a stock in reverse. I don't take big risks and I'm all in on GME. My dad doesn't take big risks and he's getting all in on GME. My coworkers don't take big risks but they're clamoring their funny money together to *get in on GME*.

I am retarded and I think a price multiple of 5 seems reasonable. Now, we have a squeeze about to happen. If you add that, even 4 digit price of the stock does not seem retarded.

It's one of those strange quirky areas in which more competition is actually bad for both business and the consumer, a bit like sports coverage - once people start being asked to buy five or six recurring subscriptions to access the bulk of the content they want, the bubble bursts and piracy returns to the top of peoples' go-to method of obtaining content.

See this all the time in Europe with sporting championships. The Rugby Union Champions' Cup is a good example, when it was restricted to Sky it was insanely popular, once they split it between Sky and BT piracy rates went through the roof because people just weren't willing to shell out for multiple expensive sports packages just to watch one tournament.

That also means timing for purchase and/or sale of any of their instruments is no longer entirely down to them, but they are employed to make money and hit targets based on, I'd imagine, monthly periods at least.

Last bit of rarely mentioned consequence is that there are not an infinite number of stocks with rabid fan-clubs. Business' yes, but the stock? TSLA maybe, and other meme stocks here possibly, GME is now rather unique. It's fan club has deeper pockets than they ever have before. This offers GME a bit of protection and positive PR *before* they have started their transformation. Gaming, PC gaming, subscription bundles, and e-commerce are all booming and that's the transformation. Their profits and debt payments from this stunt are going to be both given a boost.

We might have started this a bit optimistic about Gamestops future, but it has become a self-fulfilling prophecy now.

If people continue to hold through the dropping prices according to the chart, eventually the shares will come due and the price will jump when they run out of cheap shares to buy from scaredy cats and paper hands.

Without more high level views and current data, you have to decide whether to trust in Apes with diamond hands, or trust that hedge funds are successfully driving down and buying cheap to cover.

If ladder attacks actually happen (debated whether they are legally possible) then its all smoke and mirrors and the majority of traded shares are the same ones going back and forth between hedgies: meaning those of us holding this stupid stonk are keeping them from covering.

Maybe the Govt will force them to cover soon?  Or bail them out so they can cover... who knows.

This is abbreviated but

I’ve used them exclusively on the military side, and they’re deep in the intelligence agencies of every western country.  I see a multipolar future with several blocs of countries pitted against each other.  Palantir has repeatedly said they represent western ideology and will pick up more and more government contracts as the need for ai and data analytics is further recognized.

This will also occur in private western companies as Europe tightens data privacy laws and data analytics are used more and more frequently.  Pltr allows for data exploitation while also ensuring privacy.

My main concerns with Pltr right now are showing private sector growth, and reducing the dilution of shares with stock based compensation.

If these two things are addressed I believe the price goes back up.  I don’t think the potential value of the company is recognized now.

With that said, I don’t expect a rapid turnaround, and I am buying now to hold for years, with a goal of 5k shares.

KEEP that energy you had this morning.   Short sellers ain’t napping or snacking hoping for the best.  Not even the the day traders. They will all keep attacking the stock until they get it to where they want and the day traders will basically help it along for pennies like rats waiting  for crumbs.   

Keep that energy up.

3967,h8ndm9q,0,p2ydw5,ELLYN,TeslaALLinbby,"Dear brothers and sisters,

  
We have been in a tug of war with the hedgies for the past months. We had a technical breakout (NOT SQUEEZE) to $28.5. They pushed us down like a rock. It has been painfull. It has been frustrating with all the times they have pushed us from $10 to $8 in the span of 1/2 days. It has been frustrating with so much fake news, FUD or that a great company is being looked at as a joke or ""pump and dump"".

  
The haters were wrong. They did not do their due dilligence, because if they did they would find out that:

  
Failiure to deliver shares was as high as 19M in July. This equals to 15% of the float. FAILED to deliver. Compare this to AMC and GME at their peak, and we would beat them with 3M and 6M FTD. We are at 19M! THIS IS INSANE!

  
Shorts are NECK DEEP in this. Company is valued at over $3B. Short volume in dollars is at over $1.2B. Imagine that! Only other company I can remember that hedgies tried to kill this hard is Tesla. I was there in 2020 and it changed my life! Now $Clov will change all OUR lives! No wonder they have tried to kill momentum so many times!

  
By doing these ladder attacks and always pushing us down, hedgies are banking on making us frustrated, tired and make us panic sell. What they don´t realize is that we apes have evolved. We have social platforms on Reddit, Discord and we share information with eachother. Shorts stand for about 50% of the daily volume - and don´t get fooled, they will come hard at us today as well!

  
But we will FIGHT back. We will prevail! This is a great fucking company that will disrupt the dinosaur health care industry. Company reported over $400M in revenue, 140% increase year over year, membership is at over six digits and $Clov is growing like a beast! The Clover assistant will bring over $1B in. THIS IS INSANE. 

How is company valued only $3B? Easy, because market value doesn´t reflect the reality. If shorts were out of the picture, we´d be hovering around $25-35, but because of them, the sky is the limit.

  
My dear brothers, my dear sisters. Fuck the corrupt system. Fuck SEC and all other institutions. Fuck the 1% that always cover for each other and make life miserable to the rest of us. Don´t we deserve freedom!? Don´t we deserve to live a life where we can actually live instead of just surviving? Don´t we deserve the chance to make our own future!?

  
We will accept this no more. No longer shall corrupt hedgies be able to bankrupt great companies. No longer shall corrupt hedgies steal money from us. No longer shall they rule us by fear. FUCK FEAR. FUCK PAIN. It limits us. The system is built to limit us, to make us sheeps, to not let us reach our potential.

  
Clover Health is a company that will change lives. It will help a lot of humans. It will revolutionize the health care industry, and remember; this is only the beginning. Today, we got the catalyst we needed. The volume premarket and after hours has been insane. Today is going to be a fight, but we WILL WIN.

  
Don´t sell this stock for peanuts. It´s worth FAR more. If we look at the options for this week, if we surpass $10 and we can go as high up as $50. Should you sell? FUCK NO. Wait for MOASS. The squeeze will bring us to several hundred dollars! The fundamentals will take us to $100 in a year alone.

  
Brothers. TODAY IS OUR DAY. Far too long have they put fear and pain into us, but today - we fight back! Pain and fear is temporary, it might last for a minute, an hour, a day or even a year, but eventually it will subside and something else will take it´s place. If I quit however, it will last forever.

People forget that in order to profit you have to actually sell during the squeeze. If you convince enough people to set a stupid sell price like 1,000x, you make lower sell points more comfortable for yourself.

Anyone saying 1000x is likely planning to sell under 1000$ and leave you holding the bag once the shorts are covered.

Hodling GME is a great idea. Short Squeeze is a real thing with examples of it happening previously to other stocks eg Volkswagon. Short Squeeze is also temporary and WILL have a point where it tops out. People are posting meme prices of 4206.94 or 6942.00 because when the sell comes, **they are competing with you for the short's business**.

Set your price as you will. Keep it to yourself. Don't trust anything over $1000 unless you actually know how to make sense of the numbers.

4051,h8pm5cr,0,p2ydw5,ELLYN,bronxbambas,"Short answer: Closing at $9.01 vs $8.99 wouldn't make a difference. That was psychological. The shortest available calls expire tomorrow, anyway (not today). And calls are worthless once they expire, so the precise price a stock closes at isn't as important.

Long answer: For instance, a $9 call expiring tomorrow is a contract allowing one to purchase 100 shares of CLOV at $9/share up until the market closes tomorrow. So, if CLOV goes to $10 tomorrow morning, then a $9 call would be worth at least $100 (because the call gives one the right to buy 100 shares at $9/share, for a total of $900. If you buy back 100 shares for $900 when the stock is trading at $10, then you could immediately sell the 100 shares for a total of $1000 - a $100 profit).

Calls are just contracts people buy and sell to each other, betting on how much a stock will (or won't) be worth right before expiration.",1628806737,t3_p2ydw5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p2ydw5/daily_popular_tickers_thread_for_august_12_2021/h8pm5cr/,13,wallstreetbets,"Daily Popular Tickers Thread for August 12, 2021 - CLOV | MRNA | PLTR",comments_batch_6.csv,-1,0,0,0.166,0.702,0.132,-0.7749,1.5433631,-1.6284261

5408,h0uo0a6,0,nttgr8,RACHEL,lJustLurkingl,"Spark notes:

A short is when someone borrows shares on the condition they will pay those shares back. They then sell them at current prices, hoping the price eventually goes down, then buys them back and returns the shares. To do this, and borrow the shares, they pay a fee on these shares. So you're profitable when the stock drops a certain amount - whatever fees you added up. Therefore, time doesn't really matter. You can end up just paying these fees over time just hoping the stock goes down. As long as you can pay the fee you don't have to cover.

A put is only the same in that you anticipate the price of a stock to go down. But, a put contract is a done deal out of the gate and has a definitive date and fee set. The fee is the premium and the date is expiry. When you buy a put you are saying I will pay $x fee for the right to sell x shares of a stock at x strike price, by a certain date.

Example. ABC is trading at $15 and I think it's going to $10. I buy 1 put that expires at the end of the week at the $15 strike price. This means whoever sold me the put agrees to *buy* 100 shares of stock ABC from me for $15 / share (I don't have to own them, that's just the logic). When I bought the put the only money in I had to pay was the premium to have the right to make this agreement a reality if I'm right. If I'm wrong, I lose the premium and that's that, end of story, but it happens in that week. But, I was right, ABC went to $10 by the end of the week. I make money because now I get to *sell* ABC to that person who originally sold me the put for $15/share. So $1000 worth of shares, which cost me $10/share to get now, I get to now sell back at $15/share to that person I had an options contract with for $1500 and profit $500. ($1500 I sold for - $1000 it cost be to buy)

That's about as basic as I can lay it out. Hope that helps.",1623023244,t3_nttgr8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nttgr8/bb_amc_gme_daily_popular_ticker_thread_for_june/h0uo0a6/,15,wallstreetbets,"BB | AMC | GME - Daily Popular Ticker Thread for June 06, 2021",comments_batch_6.csv,1,0,1,0.114,0.683,0.203,0.9934,1.5574896,-1.8912016

Looks like you get the top tickers from mentions in the daily thread. This will create a meme thread for gme amc for example, which will directly cause a major drop in these tickers' mentions in the daily (since discussion for these will be moved here)

So the next day the new top mentioned tickers will be, say, tsla / bb, and discussion of gme will be once more permitted. Until the next day again meme thread is gme amc, etc...
